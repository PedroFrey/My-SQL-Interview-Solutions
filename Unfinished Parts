Question:
Tesla is investigating bottlenecks in their production, and they need your help to extract the relevant data.
Write a SQL query that determines which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

My solution:
SELECT part
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL
GROUP BY part

Standart Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT part
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL;


Learning Insights: Remember to use the HAVING clause,
it was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

Also, The SELECT DISTINCT can be used as a group by in some situations
