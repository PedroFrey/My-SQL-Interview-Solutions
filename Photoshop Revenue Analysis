Question:
For every customer that bought Photoshop, return a list of their customer_id,
and how much they spent in total for other Adobe products excluding Photoshop.

Sort your answer by customer_id in ascending order.

My solution:

SELECT customer_id,
       sum(revenue) AS revenue
FROM adobe_transactions
WHERE product != 'Photoshop'
  AND customer_id in
    (SELECT customer_id
     FROM adobe_transactions
     WHERE product = 'Photoshop')
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id ASC

Standard solution:
SELECT 
  original.customer_id,
  SUM(original.revenue) AS revenue
FROM adobe_transactions AS original
INNER JOIN adobe_transactions AS filtered
  ON original.customer_id = filtered.customer_id
  AND filtered.product = 'Photoshop'
WHERE original.product <> 'Photoshop'
GROUP BY original.customer_id
ORDER BY original.customer_id;
