Question:
Assume you are given the table below that shows job postings for all companies on the LinkedIn platform.
Write a query to get the number of companies that have posted duplicate job listings 
(two jobs at the same company with the same title and description).


My Solution:

WITH query AS
  (SELECT company_id
   FROM job_listings t
   GROUP BY company_id
   HAVING count(title) != count(DISTINCT title)
   OR count(description)!=count(DISTINCT description))
SELECT count(company_id) AS duplicate_companies
FROM query

Standard solution:

WITH jobs_grouped 
AS (
  SELECT 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description, 
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
  FROM job_listings
  GROUP BY 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description)

SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS duplicate_companies
FROM jobs_grouped
WHERE job_count > 1;


Learning Insights: The WITH statement is going to be very useful to create virtual tables and no consultations inside consultations.
I have notticed that I need to deepen my understanding of the group by function
