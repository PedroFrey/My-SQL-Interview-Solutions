Questiom:
Assume that you are given the table below containing information on viewership by device type (where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone).
Define “mobile” as the sum of tablet and phone viewership numbers. Write a query to compare the viewership on laptops versus mobile devices.

Output the total viewership for laptop and mobile devices in the format of "laptop_views" and "mobile_views".

My solution:
SELECT count(CASE
                 WHEN device_type= 'laptop' THEN 1
                 ELSE NULL
             END) AS "laptop_views",
       count(CASE
                 WHEN device_type= 'tablet'
                      OR device_type='phone'THEN 1
                 ELSE NULL
             END) AS "mobile_views"
FROM viewership

Standart Solution:
SELECT COUNT(CASE
          WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1
          ELSE NULL
      END) AS laptop_views,
COUNT(CASE
          WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1
          ELSE NULL
      END) AS mobile_views
FROM viewership;
