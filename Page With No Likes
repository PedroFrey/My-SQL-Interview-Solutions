Question:
Assume you are given the tables below about Facebook pages and page likes.
Write a query to return the page IDs of all the Facebook pages that don't have any likes. The output should be in ascending order.

My solution:
SELECT pages.page_id
FROM pages
LEFT JOIN page_likes ON page_likes.page_id = pages.page_id
WHERE page_likes.liked_date IS NULL
ORDER BY page_id ASC


Standart Solution:
SELECT page_id
FROM pages
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM page_likes AS likes
  WHERE likes.page_id = pages.page_id);
  
  or 
  
  SELECT pages.page_id
FROM pages
LEFT OUTER JOIN page_likes AS likes
  ON pages.page_id = likes.page_id
WHERE likes.page_id IS NULL;
