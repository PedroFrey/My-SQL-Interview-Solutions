Question:
You are given the tables below containing information on Robinhood trades and users.
Write a query to list the top three cities that have the most completed trade orders in descending order.


My solution:

SELECT  users.city AS "city",
       COUNT(order_id) AS "total_orders"
FROM trades
LEFT JOIN users ON trades.user_id=users.user_id
WHERE trades.status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY "city"
ORDER BY "total_orders" DESC
LIMIT 3

Standart Solution:
SELECT 
  users.city, 
  COUNT(trades.order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM trades 
INNER JOIN users 
  ON trades.user_id = users.user_id 
WHERE trades.status = 'Completed' 
GROUP BY users.city 
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 3;
