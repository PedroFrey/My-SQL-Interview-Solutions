Question:

Given a table of bank deposits and withdrawals, return the final balance for each account.
Assumption:
All the transactions performed for each account are present in the table; no transactions are missing.

My Solution:

WITH base AS (
                (SELECT account_id,
                        sum(amount)*-1 AS final_balance
                 FROM transactions w
                 WHERE transaction_type = 'Withdrawal'
                 GROUP BY account_id)
              UNION ALL
                (SELECT account_id,
                        sum(amount) AS final_balance
                 FROM transactions d
                 WHERE transaction_type = 'Deposit'
                 GROUP BY account_id))
SELECT account_id,
       sum(final_balance) AS final_balance
FROM base
GROUP BY account_id

Standard Solution

SELECT
  account_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'Deposit' THEN amount ELSE -amount END) AS final_balance
FROM transactions
GROUP BY account_id;
