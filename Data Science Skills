Question:
Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job.
You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a SQL query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

My solution:
SELECT candidate_id
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python',
                'Tableau',
                'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING count(skill) =3
ORDER BY candidate_id ASC


Standart Solution:
SELECT candidate_id
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id;

Learning insights: The columns you put on the Select Statement is what will appear on the Output,
but the operations below the Select Statement can invoke columns not present on the select statement.

Also the IN operator must use () not {}, and the IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
